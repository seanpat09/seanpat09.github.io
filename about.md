I am a man of many hats. In no particular order, I am a teacher, a freelance writer, an entrepreneur, a web developer, and technically an accountant. I also like the Oxford comma, though I have been told to stop. I work primarily on the Salesforce platform, but I am eager to learn about all aspects of programming in an effort to develop tools and products that make people's lives easier and more productive.
