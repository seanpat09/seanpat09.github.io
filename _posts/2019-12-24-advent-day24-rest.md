*In the spirit of the holiday season, this is a series of short blog posts covering random things I have learned while doing Salesforce development, one for each day of Advent.*

I didn't actually think I would make it to the last day of the advent. I hardly post once a month so trying to write a blog post every day of the advent seemed a little overambitious (though I guess I can't really speak to the quality of these posts).

I'll be taking the next few days off to get away from work and this holiday season I hope you get an opportunity to take a rest, too.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays, wherever you are.
