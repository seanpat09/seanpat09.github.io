Developer Phone Screen Questions Inspired by this blog post: http://blog.codinghorror.com/getting-the-interview-phone-screen-right/  Remember this quote from the post:  Please understand: what I'm looking for here is a total vacuum in one of these areas. It's OK if they struggle a little and then figure it out. It's OK if they need some minor hints or prompting. I don't mind if they're rusty or slow. What you're looking for is candidates who are utterly clueless, or horribly confused, about the area in question.  General Questions Why are you looking for a new job, and why Apto? Ever work on a managed package? What anyone with Salesforce experience should be able to do. If they can't answer these clearly, that's a sign that they probably don't have the necessary skills: Given an Account ID, using Apex how would I get a list of all the email addresses for all of the contacts on that account without any duplicates? How would I achieve connecting a Contact with multiple Accounts? How would this change the answer to the question above? More advance topics that a candidate should at least be able to talk about to some extent. Watch out for BS. In fact, it's better if they admit that they don't know. Difference between and Interface and an Abstract class? When would use each? Static vs. Instance Method? Method override vs overload? What's your familiarity with version control, in particular, git? Then some scenario questions for branching Scenario 1: You are currently working on a branch off of the staging branch, which is a branch off of the master branch. A bug is discovered in the master branch and you need to patch it. How would you go about setting up a branch for this fix?  Answer: They should be branching off of master on a new branch. When done, it should be merged into both master and staging Scenario 2: You just finished a feature, but the branch you were working on has not been pulled into staging yet. You want to start on another feature but it depends on stuff in the branch that hasn't been merged into staging yet. How do you go about starting a branch for the new feature?  Answer: They should create a branch off of the other branch, or some variation of that. What's your familiarity with the Salesforce Ant migration tool?
